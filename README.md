# serverless-plugin-include-dependencies

> Note: This plugin no longer excludes the `aws-sdk` to stay in line with AWS best practices (bring your own SDK)

This is a Serverless plugin that should make your deployed functions smaller.

It does this by enabling you to add your `node_modules` folder to the `exclude` list, then it individually adds each module that your handler depends on.

If you use this plugin, you should disable the built-in Serverless option for excluding development dependencies, which is slower anyway:

```yml
package:
  excludeDevDependencies: false
```

Also consider using `serverless-plugin-common-excludes` for even greater package size reduction, and `serverless-plugin-package-size` to add guards against your deployed functions so that they do not exceed a size limit that you set.

## Installation

First install the plugin via NPM.

```
npm install serverless-plugin-include-dependencies --save-dev
```

Then include the plugin within your serverless.yml config.

```yml
plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-include-dependencies
```

## Usage Example

`serverless.yml`
```yaml
service: sample

package:
  exclude:
    - node_modules/** # no need to add this yourself, this plugin does it for you

plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-include-dependencies

custom:
  includeDependencies:
    always:
      - 'src/lib/**' # (optional) always include these globs and their dependencies

functions:
  foo:
    handler: src/handler/foo.handler
  bar:
    handler: src/handler/bar.handler
```

For even smaller function packages, you can also set:

```yaml
package:
  individually: true
```
But be warned: Smaller individual functions can still mean a larger overall deployment. (10 functions that are 3 MB each is more net data tranfer and storage than 1 function that is 6 MB)

## Module Aliases
For projects using [module-alias](https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias), Webpack Alias or some other alias management package, use the `module-aliases` custom property to have it automatically resolved during Serverless packaging.

```yaml
custom:
  nodeEnv:
    dev: development
    prod: production
  module-aliases: ${file(./package.json):_moduleAliases}
```
or
```yaml
custom:
  nodeEnv:
    dev: development
    prod: production
  module-aliases:
    @lib: ./lib
    @test: ./test
```

## New In 2.0 - Exclusion Support

Rather than including module folders (e.g. `node_modules/foo/**`, it now includes a list of actual files (e.g. `node_modules/foo/package.json`, `node_modules/foo/index.js`) and *uses the serverless package exclude* to filter these files. Excludes *must* start with `node_modules` to be considered by this plugin.

The following examples would filter files of your module dependencies:

- `node_modules/**/README.*`
- `node_modules/**/test/**`

These would not:

- `README`
- `**/*.txt`

Even though normal matching libraries would match these rules, this library ignores them so that there's no chance of local excludes conflicting with node_modules excludes.

Unless you know exactly where dependencies will be installed (e.g. several things could depend on aws-sdk) you probably want a rule more like `node_modules/**/aws-sdk/**` (which will exclude all instances of aws-sdk) and not `node_modules/aws-sdk/**` (which would only exclude a top-level aws-sdk)
